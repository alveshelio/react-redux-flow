This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The goal for this project is to lean Flow Typed.
In this project I'm building a Burger Builder where we'll be saving the orders into Firebase. The ingredients for the burger will also be coming from Firebase. I'll be adding features along the way such as Authentication and the possibility to create multiple burgers and allow the user to select which one he wants to build. 

I will also start playing with Redux-saga and generators, an alternative to Redux-thunk, to handle API calls side-effects.
